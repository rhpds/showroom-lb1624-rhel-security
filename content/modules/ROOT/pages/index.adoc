= Welcome to Enabling RHEL Security: SELinux, Fapolicyd and Auditd

### Introduction

Are you ready to elevate your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) security skills and protect your systems from emerging threats? 

Join us to discover how three RHEL native tools can transform your approach to security and safeguard your digital assets!

In an era where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated, securing RHEL systems has never been more critical. Organizations rely on RHEL for its stability, performance, and security features, making it a cornerstone of many enterprise environments. However, the evolving landscape of cyber threats demands a proactive and multi-layered security strategy. This lab is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to fortify your RHEL systems against a wide range of potential vulnerabilities.

This lab delves into three pillars of Linux security:

1. **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**: SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC), providing a robust framework for enforcing security policies. By defining strict access controls, SELinux helps prevent unauthorized access and ensures that processes operate within defined security boundaries.

2. **fapolicyd**: This user-space daemon enhances file access control by monitoring and controlling file access based on predefined policies. Fapolicyd acts as an additional layer of security, complementing SELinux and other access control mechanisms.

3. **Auditd**: Responsible for logging and monitoring system calls and user activities, Auditd is a crucial tool for detecting and responding to security incidents. It provides detailed audit logs that can be analyzed to identify suspicious behavior and ensure compliance with security policies.

This lab outlines the role these tools play in creating a comprehensive security strategy for RHEL environments. It also highlights their individual functionalities and how they can be effectively utilized in tandem to enhance system security. By leveraging SELinux, fapolicyd, and Auditd, you can build a resilient security infrastructure that protects your digital assets and maintains the integrity of your systems.

These tools allow you to:

- **Provide a strong foundation for the security of your RHEL infrastructure**: By implementing these tools, you can create a secure environment that minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Satisfy Compliance requirements from frameworks like CIS, DISA STIG, or HIPAA**: Many regulatory frameworks mandate specific security controls. This lab will show you how to configure these tools to meet compliance requirements, ensuring your systems are audit-ready.
- **Monitor for malicious activity and maintain the integrity of your system**: Continuous monitoring and logging are essential for detecting and responding to security incidents. Auditd provides the necessary tools to track system activities and identify potential threats.

Attendees will leave with practical knowledge on how to install, configure, and manage these security tools, enabling them to apply what they have learned in real-world scenarios. Whether you are a system administrator, security professional, or IT manager, this lab will provide you with the skills and confidence to secure your RHEL environments effectively.

Join us on this journey to enhance your RHEL security skills and protect your systems from the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.

Lab Note: If Using Red Hat Demo System (RHPDS)
The terminal window to your right is already logged into the lab environment as the lab-user user via ssh. All steps of this lab are to be completed as the lab-user user on the bastion server.

You should be able to click the clipboard icon in the code box to copy the command, and you will eather use the middle mouse button or right click and paste. The keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste (ctrl+c and ctrl+v) wontâ€™t work in this.
