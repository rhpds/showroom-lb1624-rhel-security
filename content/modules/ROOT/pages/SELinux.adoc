# SELinux 
## Objective

By the end of this guided lab exercise, you will be able to:

1. Understand what SELinux is and its role in system security.
2. Configure basic SELinux settings.
3. Troubleshoot common SELinux issues.
4. Manage SELinux booleans and contexts.

## Introduction

SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security architecture for Linux systems, providing mechanisms for supporting access control security policies. This lab will
guide you through initial setup and configuration of SELinux, as well as troubleshooting common issues.

## Step 1: Verify SELinux Status

First, let's check if SELinux is currently enabled on your system. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sestatus
```

If SELinux is enabled, you should see output similar to this:

```
SELinux status:                 enabled
```

## Step 2: Basic SELinux Configuration

### 2.1 SELinux Modes

SELinux can operate in three modes: Enforcing, Permissive, and Disabled.

- **Enforcing:** Applies the security policy strictly, denying any actions not explicitly allowed by the defined policies. This is the secure mode and is
recommended for production systems.

- **Permissive:** Logs denied operations but does not block them. It's useful for debugging without disrupting system operation.

- **Disabled:** SELinux policies are not enforced, but logs are still active.

To change the SELinux mode, use the `setenforce` command:

```bash
sudo setenforce 1   # Enforcing
sudo setenforce 0   # Permissive
sudo setenforce 0   # Disabled (not recommended without good reason)
```

### 2.2 View Current SELinux Settings

Check current SELinux settings with:

```bash
cat /etc/selinux/config
```

## Step 3: Managing SELinux Booleans

SELinux booleans are on/off switches that enable or disable specific SELinux protections. To list all available booleans, run:

```bash
getsebool -a
```

To toggle a boolean (for example, `httpd_can_network_connect`), use the `setsebool` command:

```bash
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on  # Permanently enable
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect off # Permanently disable
```

## Step 4: Managing SELinux Contexts

Contexts define the security attributes of files and processes. You can view the context of a file with `ls -Z`:

```bash
ls -Z /etc/selinux/config
```

To change a file's context, use the `chcon` command:

```bash
sudo chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html  # Change context for Apache web content directory
```

## Step 5: Troubleshooting SELinux Issues

When encountering SELinux denials, use the `audit2why` command to translate AVC (Access Vector Cache) messages into human-readable form:

```bash
sudo audit2why -n /var/log/audit/audit.log  | more
```

Alternatively, check the SELinux log with:

```bash
cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep avc
```
