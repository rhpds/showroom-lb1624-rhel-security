**Lab Title: Auditing with AuditD in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9**

Objective: By the end of this lab, you will understand the nomenclature associated with AuditD, comprehend its functionality and purpose in RHEL 9, and be able to test for AuditD controls.

# Nomenclature Definitions

- **Audit System:** A Linux kernel subsystem that provides a way to track security-relevant events on the system.

- **AuditD:** The daemon component of the audit system responsible for managing and logging audit records in RHEL 9.

- **Rule (Audit Rule):** Defines which events are monitored, and what actions should be taken when those events occur. These rules are stored in files under `/etc/audit/` with a `.rules` extension.

- **Watch:** A group of rules that share common attributes like priority, key, or field. The `auditctl` command can be used to manage watches.

- **Log File:** A file where audit records are stored. The default location for log files is `/var/log/audit/audit.log`.

- **Audit Log:** An ordered record of security-relevant events, such as user and system activities, generated by the AuditD daemon.

- **Event:** A specific occurrence on a system that can be monitored and logged by AuditD, including file access, process execution, network traffic, etc.

- **Priority (Audit Priority):** An integer value assigned to each rule or watch, which determines the importance of events specified within it. Lower priority values have higher precedence.

- **Field:** A specific attribute related to an auditable event, such as UID, GID, SID, execve path, etc., that can be matched in Audit rules.

- **Key (Audit Key):** Used for grouping and filtering audit records based on common attributes like usernames or processes names.

# High Level Overview of AuditD

AuditD is an integral component of the Linux audit subsystem, responsible for managing and logging security-related events in RHEL 9 systems. Its primary role is to monitor and record system activities, providing valuable insights into potential security breaches or policy violations. Through configuration files (`.rules`) and command-line utilities (`auditctl`), AuditD can be customized to capture specific events based on user-defined rules and priorities.

AuditD logs its records in dedicated log files, usually located at `/var/log/audit/audit.log`, where administrators can analyze them using various tools (e.g., `ausearch` or `aulast`). By leveraging AuditD, organizations can enforce accountability and compliance with security policies and regulatory requirements.
