== Welcome to Enabling RHEL Security: SELinux, Fapolicyd and Auditd

= Are You Ready to Elevate Your Red Hat Enterprise Linux Security Skills?

In an era where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated, securing Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems has never been more critical. In this lab, we'll explore three RHEL native tools that can transform your approach to security and safeguard your digital assets:

. **SELinux** (Security-Enhanced Linux) implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
. **Fapolicyd** serves as a user-space daemon that enhances file access control
. **Auditd** is responsible for logging and monitoring system calls and user activities

By utilizing these three tools together, you can create a comprehensive security strategy that protects your RHEL systems from emerging threats. SELinux provides a strong foundation for security, fapolicyd enhances file access control, and Auditd helps monitor system activity for potential threats. Together, they can help ensure the security of your digital assets and protect your infrastructure from cyber attacks.

=== You will learn how to:

Users will leave with practical knowledge on how to install, configure, and manage these security tools, enabling them to apply what they have learned in real-world scenarios.
